	<h2>A Fun Trip</h2>
	<p>Last Summer I went to Italy with my cousins, and it was the <STRONG>adventure of a lifetime.</STRONG> The sights, food, and people were all wonderful and it was truly an experience I would love to have again. Travel in Italy was very straight-forward, and I definitely got all my steps in each day we were there.</p>
	<h2>Favorite Pet Names</h2>
	<p>My 3 favorite pet names are: <ul> <li>Brazy for a dog</li> <li>Moss for an alpaca</li> <li>Miso for a cat</li></ul></p>
	<h2>My Favorite Restaurant</h2>
	<p>My favorite restaurant is <a href="https://www.agorarestaurants.net/dc-about-us/" target="_blank">Agora</a> in Washington D.C. This restaurant is not too far from me and is always a great choice for any meal, brunch, lunch, dinner, you name it. Their spreads are delicious and the ambience is cozy but luxurious at the same time. I have never been disappointed with this restaurant- and I don't think I will be in the future.</p><div>
	<h2>My Favorite Dish</h2>

	<p>Despite a Mediterranean restaurant being my favorite, my favorite dish to eat is actually Panang Curry (pictured on the left). It is a Thai curry that is loaded with vegetables and has a bit of a kick. It is traditionally eaten with white rice, but I actually prefer to eat it with wide rice noodles.</p>
